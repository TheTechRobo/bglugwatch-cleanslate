## NOTE: Updates may be delayed as my main priority is Palc...and I REALLY want to request an API from bglug.ca
# bglugwatch
Tkinter program for easy viewing of BGLUG's website  
## NOTE: It is horribly out of date, in a few months I am hoping to get an API onto the bglug website so it auto-updates.

# To start
If you want to test your changes to `bglug.py`:    
`python3 bglug.py`  
This will **not** overwrite your current `bglug.py`.  
If you are a normal user who wants to use the latest version:  
`python3 runthis.py`

# What is BGLUG?
Bruce-Grey Linux User's Group is designed to help newcomers (and oldcomers) with Linux. We discuss things, give things away, and more!

# Are there pre-built binaries?
Go [here](https://github.com/thetechrobo/bglugwatch-binaries) for binaries. (They may be out of date.)  
I used PyInstaller for building the binaries.
