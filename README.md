# How to translate?
For the file you want to translate, create a file with the following layout:
`<filename>.<langcode>.<extention>`
So, if you were translating README.md to French (Canada), you would make the file like so:
`README.fr-CA.md`
Or, bglug.py to French (France):
`bglug.fr-FR.py`

Then, PR your changes. (Try to finish the file, but if you can't, do as much as you can.)
