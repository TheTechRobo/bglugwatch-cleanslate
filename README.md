Tkinter program for easy viewing of BGLUG's website

# What is BGLUG?
Bruce-Grey Linux User's Group is designed to help newcomers (and oldcomers) with Linux. We discuss things, give things away, and more!

# Are there pre-built binaries?
Go [here](https://github.com/thetechrobo/bglugwatch-binaries) for binaries. (They may be out of date.)  
I used PyInstaller for building the binaries.
