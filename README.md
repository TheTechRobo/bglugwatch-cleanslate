## NOTE: Updates are delayed as my main priority is Palc. An API has been requested but it's unknown if it's possible.
# bglugwatch
Tkinter program for easy viewing of BGLUG's website  

# To start
If you want to test your changes to `bglug.py`:    
`python3 bglug.py`  
This will **not** overwrite your current `bglug.py`.  
If you are a normal user who wants to use the latest version:  
`python3 runthis.py`

# What is BGLUG?
Bruce-Grey Linux User's Group is designed to help newcomers (and oldcomers) with Linux. We discuss things, give things away, and more!

# Are there pre-built binaries?
No, but maybe in the future as now they don't need to be up to date unless the updating mechanism changes.

# BGLUGwatch is unfinished!
I am still working on it, stay tuned!
